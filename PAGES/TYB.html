                    <span style=" font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px;">PROBLEM </span><br>
                    There is overwhelming amounts of data, intended to govern how we live our lives during quarantine. Some data is confusing, there is conflicting information, a general discomfort and uncertainty. There has been unhealthy and overwhelming social media push towards extreme productivity and personal growth during quarantine.<br><br>
                    <span style=" font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px;">BACKGROUND </span><br>
                    Theres a huge problem with motivation, it's a conundrum of the quarantine. <br><br>
                    <span style=" font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px;">INSPIRATION </span><br>
                    Posters done by markyoder.designs in a similar fashion. "Why You Should Ignore All That Coronavirus-Inspired Productivity Pressure" by Aisha S. Ahmad, a manifesto concerning real personal care, motivation, and fear during the quarantine. So far also some visual inspiration from where the sidewalk ends and cartoons in the new yorker.<br><br>
                    <span style=" font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px;">SOLUTION </span><br>
                    I'm going to work on typographic posters that will visualize corona virus/social distancing data visualized through shared struggles and humor with a call for trying to be ok.<br><br>
                    <span style=" font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px;">PROCESS </span><br>
                    I have 2 ideas I'm currently working on. Social distancing, 6 ft distance + step on the crack, break your mothers back. Life of corona virus on different surfaces + the life of a sourdough starter or bread rising. <br><br>
                    New ideas! Concerning washing your hands - keeping it simple with a lot of humor. Wash often and for 30 seconds + drinking many cups of coffee in a day. And the infamous sneeze, that can travel and carry the virus 26 feet w/out a mask + that being farther than I move on a daily basis, being quarantined and all.<br><br>
                    I'm happy with a system of four posters, and the spectrum of data/directions I've been able to represent fully with the set of four. <br><br>
